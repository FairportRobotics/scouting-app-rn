## Github

The repo is named `scouting-app-rn` and the repository name is [scouting-app-rn](https://github.com/FairportRobotics/scouting-app-rn).

## Expo

I created an Expo Dev account using

scouting@fairportrobotics.org
scouting.fairportrobotics
(same password as Apple ID for now)

I then created a new organization as this seems to be required in order to connect Expo to Github.

From the source code folder, I ran the following commands to bind the repository to Expo:

```
npm install --global eas-cli
eas init --id a90a99f4-e77c-475d-9318-74c9c62a3396
```

Once that was completed, I kicked off a build and publish with:

```
eas update
```

## Resources

### Icons

Using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free) for icons as SVGs in React Native are not trivial.

### Storage

Deciding what to do for storage.
